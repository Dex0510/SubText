2. Market Analysis
2.1 Total Addressable Market (TAM)
Primary Market: US Adults in Relationships

Total US adults in relationships: 150M
Experiencing relationship uncertainty annually: 20M (13%)
Willing to pay for analysis: 2M (10% of uncertain)
TAM: 2M × $30 avg (Pro $20 + MRI/Chat upsells) = $60M annual

Secondary Markets:

Breakup validation: 750k divorces/year × $30 = $22.5M
Dating app users: 40M active × 5% need = 2M × $30 = $60M
Total TAM: $142.5M annual

Note: Lower per-user revenue offset by higher expected conversion rate at $20 price point vs $49.

2.2 Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)
Realistic capture within 3 years:

Digital-native, therapy-aware, 24-38 demographic: 40% of TAM
SAM: $93M annual

2.3 Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)
Target within 18 months:

1% market penetration of SAM
SOM: $930k annual = $77k/month

Conservative first-year target: $50k/month = $600k annual

2.4 Competitive Analysis
Direct Competitors:
CompetitorStrengthWeaknessOur AdvantageChatGPT/ClaudeFree, familiarGeneric, no memory, safety-biasedForensic rigor, multi-agent, data-drivenTherapyProfessional, credible$150/session, subjective$20/conv, objective, data-basedMei (YC W23)VC-backed, therapist networkCoaching model, subscriptionPer-conversation, forensic not coachingLastingEstablished, 1M downloadsCouples-focused, exercisesIndividual, diagnostic not prescriptive
Competitive Moats:

Zero-knowledge architecture (technically complex to replicate)
Multi-agent verification (prevents hallucination, builds trust)
Timeline stitching (unique UX, difficult to copy)
Forensic positioning (different category, not direct competition)
Per-conversation pricing (affordable entry, no subscription lock-in)

Competitive Risks:

OpenAI or Anthropic adds relationship analysis to ChatGPT (6-12 month risk)
Well-funded competitor (Mei, Lasting) pivots to forensic model (12-18 month risk)
Dating apps (Hinge, Bumble) build in-house (18-24 month risk)

Mitigation Strategy:

Move fast, capture market share before competition emerges
Build brand as category leader ("the 23andMe of relationships")
Create data moat (better patterns from more analyses)
Lock in distribution (therapist partnerships, content SEO)


2.5 Market Trends
Favorable Trends:

AI adoption increasing: 65% of US adults have used ChatGPT (2025)
Therapy normalization: 41% of adults have been to therapy (up from 31% in 2020)
Dating app fatigue: Users seeking tools to vet matches earlier
Privacy awareness: Zero-knowledge architecture is selling point
Self-diagnosis culture: 23andMe, genetic testing acceptance growing

Headwinds:

AI skepticism: "AI can't understand relationships" objection
Privacy fears: Intimate data sharing is scary
Therapy purist backlash: "This isn't real therapy" criticism
Economic uncertainty: Discretionary spending may decrease

Net Assessment: Market timing is FAVORABLE (7/10)

5.2 Cost Structure
Fixed Costs (Monthly):

Founder salary: $4,000 (minimal, bootstrap mode)
Infrastructure (AWS, hosting): $500
Tools (Stripe, analytics, email): $200
Legal/insurance: $1,000 (amortized)
Total Fixed: $5,700/month

Variable Costs (Per Pro Upgrade):

AI inference (OpenAI/Anthropic): $2.50 (Deep Analysis + MRI queries)
OCR processing: $0.30
Storage: $0.20
Total COGS: ~$3/Pro upgrade (no PDF generation cost)

Marketing Costs:

Months 1-6: $2,000/month (content, tools, testing)
Months 7-12: $5,000/month (paid ads begin)
Months 13-18: $8,000/month (scale winners)

One-Time Costs:

MVP development: $10,000 (if outsourced) or $0 (if solo founder)
Legal setup (ToS, privacy policy): $3,000
Security audit: $10,000 (month 6)
Brand/design: $5,000
Total One-Time: $28,000


5.3 Unit Economics
Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):

Organic (SEO, Reddit, viral): $15-25 (lower price → higher organic conversion)
Paid (Facebook/Instagram ads): $40-60
Blended CAC Target: $30

Lifetime Value (LTV):

First Pro upgrade: $26 (Pro $20 + MRI unlimited $4 avg + Chat Recommender $2 avg)
Second conversation (15% probability): $26
Referral credit: -$5 (cost of incentive)
LTV: $32

LTV:CAC Ratio: 1.07

Below ideal (3.0) but compensated by:
- Higher conversion rate (20-30% vs 15-20% at $49)
- Lower price removes friction, drives volume
- MRI Q&A and Chat Recommender create ongoing engagement
Path to 2.0+ within 12 months via:

Increasing multi-conversation usage (reduce effective CAC)
Improving MRI Unlimited attach rate (target 50%+)
Chat Recommender adoption driving recurring revenue
Viral coefficient growth (lower barrier to share)



Contribution Margin:

Revenue per customer: $26
COGS: $3
CAC: $30
Contribution: -$7/customer initially (negative — requires volume)

Note: Unit economics are tighter at $20 vs $49. Strategy relies on:
1. Higher conversion rate compensating lower per-user revenue
2. Multi-conversation users increasing LTV
3. Viral loop reducing blended CAC below $25
4. MRI Q&A engagement increasing retention and repeat usage

Break-Even Analysis:

Fixed costs: $5,700/month
Contribution per customer (at scale, CAC $20): $3
Break-even: 1,900 Pro upgrades/month
At $26 average: $49,400 MRR to break even (including paid CAC costs)
Organic-only break-even: 248 customers/month ($6,448 MRR)

Path to Profitability:

Month 6: Organic-only profitability ($15,600 revenue, low marketing spend)
Month 10: Full profitability at scale ($44,200 revenue)
Month 12: $52k revenue, ~$20k profit/month
Reinvest profits into growth (not pure profitability focus)


5.4 Funding Requirements
Bootstrap Path (Recommended):

Personal savings or friends/family: $50,000
Allocation:

6 months runway (living expenses): $24,000
One-time costs (legal, security, design): $18,000
Marketing budget (months 1-6): $8,000


Breakeven by month 8-9, profitable by month 10-12

Venture Path (Alternative):

Pre-seed round: $250,000
Allocation:

Team (hire 1 engineer): $120,000
Founder salary (12 months): $60,000
Marketing: $40,000
Infrastructure/tools: $20,000
Legal/compliance: $10,000


Faster growth, $50k MRR by month 10-12

Recommendation: Bootstrap

Preserves equity
Forces discipline and focus
Venture is overkill for this business model
Can always raise later if needed for expansion

$); payment plans if needed


7.2 Mitigation Strategies
For Poor PMF:

DO NOT scale marketing until validated
Manual analysis first (50+ users)
Measure: "Would you be disappointed if this product went away?" (>40% yes = PMF)
Iterate weekly based on feedback

For Low Viral Growth:

Optimize for "share-worthy moments" in report
Test 10+ report designs (A/B test)
Add specific shareable cards (anonymized insights)
Measure share rate weekly, pause if <15%

For High CAC:

Focus on organic channels first 6 months
Only scale paid when CAC <$50 AND LTV improves
Build content moat (100+ SEO articles)
Leverage Reddit/community (free distribution)

For Legal Risk:

Retain lawyer for ToS review ($3k)
Purchase E&O insurance before launch ($20k/year)
Never use diagnostic language ("This IS gaslighting" → "Patterns consistent with...")
Include therapy resources in every report
Build abuse detection (flag dangerous patterns)

For Privacy Risk:

Zero-knowledge is NON-NEGOTIABLE
Security audit before public launch ($10k)
Penetration testing quarterly
Open-source client code (transparency)
Bug bounty program ($500-5k rewards)

9. Exit Strategy

Scenario 1: Strategic Acquisition (18-36 months)

Acquirers: Dating apps (Match Group, Bumble), therapy platforms (BetterHelp, Talkspace), consumer AI (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
Valuation: $3-8M (5-10x revenue at $600k-800k ARR)
Timing: Once proven model, before competition commoditizes

Scenario 2: Series A Fundraising (24-36 months)

If: $100k+ MRR, strong growth, clear path to $1M ARR
Amount: $3-5M at $15-20M valuation
Use: Scale marketing, hire team, expand product

Scenario 3: Profitable Bootstrap (ongoing)

If: Plateau at $50-100k MRR, don't want VC path

Outcome: $300-600k annual profit for founder

Scenario 4: Shutdown (12-24 months)

If: Can't reach $20k MRR or unit economics don't work
